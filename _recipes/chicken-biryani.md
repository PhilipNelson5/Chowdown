- 1/2 lemon juiced
- 4 oz plain yogurt
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken legs or thighs

directions:
- Set a cast skillet over medium heat. Add the vegetable oil.
- While heating, finely slice 1/2 of the onion into rings.
- Add the bay leaves and fry for 15 seconds.
- Toss in the sliced onions and fry for 8-10 minutes until lightly browned, be careful not to burn them!
- Meanwhile, add 1/2 the onion, garlic, ginger, cloves, black peppercorns, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, poppy seeds, salt, and lemon to a food processor and pulse until smooth.
- Place the marinade paste, yogurt, and chicken in a bowl and mix to combine.
- Remove half of the fried onions with a slotted spoon and set aside.
- Reserve some of the oil and bay leaves for garnish later on.
- Add the chicken and cook for 8 minutes until the marinade has reduced by half.
- Set a pot of water on to boil the rice.
- Preheat the oven to 300 F.
- Add the rice to the boiling water and parboil the rice for 8-10 minutes, then drain in a colander.
- Soak the saffron (or turmeric) in hot but not boiling milk.
- Remove the chicken from the stove and layer the rice over top. Pour the saffron milk over the rice in orange lines. Spoon the onion-flavored oil from the pan along with the bay leaves.
- Cover the dish with aluminum foil and place the lid over top to seal the dish. Bake for 10-15 minutes.
- Spoon the biryani onto a plate and sprinkle with fried onions and other garnishes of your choice.
