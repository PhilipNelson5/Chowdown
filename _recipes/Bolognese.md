recipeYield: 10 servings


ingredients:
- olive oil
- 1/3 lb carrots
- 1/3 large red onion
- 1/3 lb chicken livers
- 1 lbs ground meat (I like to use beef and lamb)
- 2 oz tomato paste
- 1 28 oz cans crushed tomatoes
- 1/3 bottle white wine
- Liquid chicken bouillon (or a stock cube)
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp dried parsley
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 3 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
- pepper
- salt
- 2 cups cream/milk (optional)

directions:
- Peel and finely chop the carrots and onion (use a food processor or box grater).
- In a large pot (at least 7 quarts), fry the vegetables in olive oil on high heat until soft, stirring constantly. Dump them out into a bowl or plate.
- Finely chop the livers until almost pureed.
- In the big pot, fry the ground meat in olive oil on high heat, stirring and scraping constantly with a wooden spoon to keep meatballs from forming. Cook until most of the water evaporates and the pan starts to crackle.
- Put in the livers and the tomato paste and stir to combine.
- When the brown stuff on the bottom of the pot looks like it's about to burn, pour in the wine and scrape to release everything on the bottom.
- Stir in a big spoonful of the bouillon. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for two hours, stirring occasionally to make sure the bottom doesn't stick and burn.
- After two hours, season the sauce with the herbs and vinegar.
- Simmer an additional hour.
- Add cream (optional) and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. 
- Use, or freeze in ice cube trays, or both. After thawing and reheating, add a few more drops of balsamic vinegar.
