recipeYield: 4

ingredients:
- 4 oz (113g) hard salami, bacon or other cured fatty meat (or skip it)
- 1 1/2 lb (680g) leeks
- 1 1/2 lb (680g) potatoes (any kind but I prefer waxy)
- 32 oz (946mL) (1 carton) of stock (I use chicken but any kind is fine)
- 1 cup (237mL) cream (or milk)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary or whatever you have)

directions:
- Cut the meat into big chunks and put it in a cold soup pot on moderate heat. Stir occasionally to make sure it doesn't burn.
- Cut leeks in half or quarters and dice. Use the white and some of the green end. The very tops get tough.
- Put the leaks in with the meat, stir, and let soften for a few minutes.
- Peel and cut your potatoes into chunks as big as you want. Drop those in the pot, stir and let everything cook for a few minutes.
- Pour in enough stock to cover all the solids, cover and simmer until the potatoes are fork tender, maybe a half hour.
- Stir in the cream and simmer until you see the cream thicken just a little.
- Puree the soup partially or smooth (partial is my preference) or don't puree it at all. Live your own life. 
- If you want the soup a little thinner, add more stock. Flavor with salt, pepper and herbs to taste.
