recipeYield: 4

ingredients:
- 1 lb dark chicken meat (pork or beef would work too)
- 2 Tbsp high smoke point oil (peanut, ghee, avocado)
- 2 clove garlic
- 2 thumb ginger
- 3 whole peeled tomatoes (canned or fresh)
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/4 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp kashmiri chile powder (substitute cayenne)
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 30 cranks black pepper
- Sprinkle of MSG (optional)
- 5 green chiles, chopped in half
- 1 Tbsp butter (optional)
- Cilantro leaves

directions:
- Prep all the components - chop the chicken, crush the garlic and 1 thumb of ginger into a paste, separate tomatoes, gather all spices, chop chiles, julienne ginger, and chopped cilantro leaves.
- Set a wok over high heat and add the oil. Once hot, add the chicken and a generous sprinkle of salt. Cook while stirring until the chicken is cooked on the exterior.
- Add the garlic and ginger paste and saute for 30 seconds.
- Add the whole peeled tomatoes and cook while stirring for 5-10 minutes until the tomatoes start to break down. Crush the tomatoes with a spatula to develop the sauce.
- Add the spices and stir into the sauce. Let the sauce reduce for another 5-10 minutes until it is fairly thick.
- Toss in the chiles, and butter if using. Let the sauce reduce further until your desired consistency. It should be fairly thick and glossy. Turn off the heat. TASTE IT! Add salt to enhance the flavors.
- With the heat off, add the julienned ginger and cilantro leaves. Toss once and serve with rice, roti, or eat as is.
