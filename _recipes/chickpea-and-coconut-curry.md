recipeYield: 

ingredients:
- 1 lb (454g) dry chickpeas (or about twice that in canned chickpeas, rinsed and drained)
- 1 lb (454g) fresh green beans
- 1 lb (454g) fresh tomatillos (could replace with canned, or with more tomatoes)
- 1 28 oz (794g) can whole plum tomatoes
- 1-2 14 oz (414mL) cans of coconut cream
- 1 onion
- 1 bell pepper
- 2-3 fresh chilies (I used jalapeños)
- 3-4 garlic cloves
- 3-4 tablespoons Indian-style spice mixture
- basmati rice (I make half a cup, 100g of dry rice per person)
- two stock cubes (I used OXO meat-free beef cubes made of yeast extract, but you could use all kinds of things, or skip it)
- white wine (optional)
- sugar (optional)
- fresh cilantro (coriander leaves) or other green herb for garnish

directions:
- Soak chickpeas in water overnight
- Drain and put in a pot of salted water
- Bring to a hard boil for a few minutes and reduce to a simmer and cover for about an hour, until tender
- Chop the onion
- Add to a big pan with olive oil on high heat
- Chop the peppers and add to the pan
- Chop garlic and add to the pan
- Cook until fond is close to burning
- Chop tomatillos and add to pan to deglaze
- When the tomatillos are soft and brown, stir in the tomatoes and their liquid, using them to deglaze the pan again
- Stir in your spice mixture and a big splash of white wine (if using)
-  Simmer it for about an hour, until everything is soft and mushy. Stir it occasionally and replenish with more wine or water if it's getting so thick that it might stick to the pan and burn
- Wash and drain the rice a few times
-  stir in a pinch of salt and some whole mustard seeds, cover, bring to a boil
-  reduce to a simmer and cook until all water is absorbed — maybe 15 minutes. Fluff with a fork and hold in on warm until you're ready to eat.
- When the sauce is done cooking you can pass it through a sieve or hit it with a stick blender.
- Now is when you'd add canned chickpeas
- Chop green beans and add to sauce, they'll release a decent amount of water
- Add coconut cream or milk
- Add stock cubes/concentrate or yeast extract
- Taste for seasoning, and consider adding salt, sugar, more liquid, more cream

components:
- Garam Masala
