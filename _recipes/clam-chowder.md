tags: dinner soup
recipeYield: 6 to 8 bowls

ingredients:
- 1 3/4 lbs russet potatoes
- 2 6.5 oz cans chopped clams
- 2 cups finely chopped onion
- 2 tsp pepper
- 2 10 oz cans whole baby clams
- 2 cups light cream or half and half
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons instant mashed potato flakes
- Oyster Crackers

directions:
- Peel and cut potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes
- Cover potatoes with 1 inch of water
- Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are al dente, about 3 minutes
- Drain potatoes in colander and transfer to medium bowl. Let potatoes cool completely, about 30 minutes
- Finely dice the onion
- Add chopped clams and their juice, onion, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper to potatoes and stir to combine
- Transfer mixture to 1-gallon zipper-lock bag, seal bag, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour up to 24 hours
- When ready to finish cooking chowder, drain whole clams in fine-mesh strainer set over bowl; reserve juice (need 1 cup; add water to make up difference)
- Combine potato/onion/clam mixture, clam juice, and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in large saucepan
- Bring to bare simmer over medium heat (bubbles should just begin to form along edge of saucepan), about 10 minutes
- Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often and adjusting heat to keep chowder just below simmer, until potatoes are mostly tender, about 5 minutes.
- Stir in whole clams and cream
- Increase heat to medium and cook, stirring often to keep chowder just below simmer, until potatoes are fully tender and chowder is hot throughout, about 5 minutes
- Off heat, stir in butter and potato flakes, if using, until combined
