recipeYield: 12

ingredients:
- 2 cups (473mL) milk
- 1/2 stick (75g) butter, melted (plus more for brushing, if wanted)
- 2 eggs (plus one more for egg wash, if wanted)
- 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon (15g) coarse salt
- 1 tablespoon (9g) dry yeast
- all-purpose flour (about 5 cups, 600g, but I mix it by feel)

directions:
- Measure out your milk
- Put about 1/2 cup (60g) of your flour into a small saucepan
- whisk in enough of your milk to make a paste
- Bring to a simmer to make it thicken into a stiff paste. Kill the heat and gradually whisk in the rest of the milk
- Transfer the milk mixture to a large mixing bowl, it shouldn't be too hot to kill the yeast
- Stir in the yeast, sugar, salt, eggs and as much flour as you can stir in with a spoon
- Cover and let sit for about 15 minutes, to let the flour hydrate and autolyze
- Pour the melted butter in with the dough and scatter heavily with flour, to help you "grip" it and get it kneaded into the dough, which you should do now with your hands 
- Knead in enough flour to get a reasonably smooth, satiny dough that dry enough to form into a roll, but still a little sticky
- Cover and let rise until about doubled, a couple hours on the counter or overnight in the fridge
- Punch down the dough and divide it into a dozen pieces
- Flatten each piece out and then roll it up into a ball, per the video
- Line a standard square baking pan with parchment paper or grease, put in all the balls (they should be just touching), cover and let proof on the counter for a half hour
- If you want to, score the tops of the rolls
- Brush them with either melted butter or egg wash, and bake at 375ºF (190ºC) until the turn brown and stop puffing up, ~ half an hour
